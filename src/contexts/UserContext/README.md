The Context provides the user data and the functions to manipulate it.

The Context is split into two parts:

- The `UserContext` object, which is the Context itself.
- The `UserContextActions` object, which is the Context Actions.

The `UserContext` object provides access to the user data.
The `UserContextActions` object provides functions to manipulate the user data.

This approach allows the separation of concerns and makes the code more readable and maintainable.
